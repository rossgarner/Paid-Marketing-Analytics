# Paid-Marketing-Analytics
Analyzing Paid Media Campaign Data from GCM360

After studying Datacamp's Python Fundamentals Track in full and doing some courses in both the Data Manipulation and Importing & Cleaning Skills Tracks I decided to download all my paid marketing data from GCM in order to work on campaign analysis for the FY just ended
This is WIP and will be updated weekly
My next step right now is to split out conversions from YouTube from the overall CM360 site that our agency runs all our paid display and paid YouTube ads from
After that we will have a better view on conversions by channel/placement

Next I will calculate the conversion rates and plot them by channel and other summary statistics and others to complete the EDA

After completing the EDA its time to run some models to find out some insights
